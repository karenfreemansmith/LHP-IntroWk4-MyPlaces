### Description
__*A website to show where I've been.*__

Make a website where you can enter places you've been. Each place will be an object that can have a couple different properties, like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc. Then display those properties when a user clicks on each place. Make sure to do the business logic for your place object first.
